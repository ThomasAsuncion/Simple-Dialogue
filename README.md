## Dialogue Features
A simple dialogue system made with Unity (ver. 2019.3.8f1). 

This dialogue system supports multiple lines of dialogue. Animations and effects have been implanted to make it more visually appealing as well as the ability to adjust dialogue speed. Skipping prevention has been implemented and triggering the dialogue is as easy as attaching the Dialogue Trigger script to the object that will initiate a conversation.
